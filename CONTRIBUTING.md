## Branches

- We work in branches off of `main`.
- Our release (aka. _production_) branch is `main`.
- Our work happens in _topic_ branches (feature and/or bug-fix).
  - Feature as well as bug-fix branches are based on `main`
  - Branches _should_ be kept up-to-date using `rebase`

## Pull Requests

- Develop features and bug fixes in _topic_ branches off main, or forks.
- _Topic_ branches can live in forks (external contributors) or within this repository (internal contributors).  
  - When creating _topic_ branches in this repository please prefix with `<initials>/`. For example: `mb/refactor-tests`.
- Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) to drive semver versioning. Examples:
  - `chore: my chore message` --> No release
  - `fix: my fix message` --> Patch release
  - `feat: my feat message` --> Minor release
- PRs will be reviewed and merged by the CLI team.

## Releasing

- A new version of this plugin (`@salesforce/prettier-config`) will be published upon merging PRs to `main`, with the version number increment based on commitizen rules.
